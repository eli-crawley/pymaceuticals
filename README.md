# PyMaceuticals Data Analysis

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing clinical trial data involving various drug regimens and their effects on mice.

## Overview

The notebook processes and analyzes data on:
- Tumor volumes and metastatic sites in mice over time.
- Drug regimens and their effectiveness.
- Relationships between mouse metadata (e.g., sex, weight, age) and study results.

## Files

- **`pymaceuticals.ipynb`**: The main notebook containing the data processing, analysis, and visualizations.
- **`data/Mouse_metadata.csv`**: Metadata about the mice involved in the study.
- **`data/Study_results.csv`**: Results from the clinical trials, including tumor volume measurements and timepoints.

## Key Features

- Data Cleaning and Merging: Combines mouse metadata and study results into a single dataset.
- Statistical Analysis: Investigates relationships between drug regimens and outcomes.
- Visualization: Generates plots to illustrate trends and findings.

## Dependencies

This project uses Python 3.X and the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`
- `pathlib`

Ensure these libraries are installed before running the notebook. You can install them using:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib scipy
```

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook pymaceuticals.ipynb
   ```
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to load data, process it, and generate insights.
